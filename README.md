# InstanceCoffee
This project is a collection of code that I worked on in my Unity Game project for Instance Coffee over the course of a 3 weeks.
These c# files are used in order to either control a character control with a fully fucntioning third person camera behind it
OR to be used to control a fully functional AI with multiple states and a fully motion driven movement.
